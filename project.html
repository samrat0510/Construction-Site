			The most popular method of residential construction in North America is wood-framed construction. Typical construction steps for a single-family or small multi-family house are:

Obtain an engineered soil test of lot where construction is planned. From an engineer or company specializing in soil testing.<br>
Develop floor plans and obtain a materials list for estimations (more recently performed with estimating software)<br>
Obtain structural engineered plans for foundation and structure. To be completed by either a licensed engineer or architect. To include both a foundation and framing plan.
Obtain lot survey<br>
Obtain government building approval if necessary<br>
If required obtain approval from HOA (homeowners association) or ARC (architectural review committee)<br>
Clear the building site (demolition of existing home if necessary)<br>
Survey to stake out for the foundation<br>
Excavate the foundation and dig footers (Scope of work is dependent of foundation designed by engineer)<br>
Install plumbing grounds<br>
Pour a foundation and footers with concrete<br>
Build the main load-bearing structure out of thick pieces of wood and possibly metal I-beams for large spans with few supports. See framing (construction)
Add floor and ceiling joists and install subfloor panels<br>
Cover outer walls and roof in OSB or plywood and a water-resistive barrier.<br>
Install roof shingles or other covering for flat roof<br>
Cover the walls with siding, typically vinyl, wood, or brick veneer but possibly stone or other materials<br>
Install windows<br>
Frame interior walls with wooden 2Ã—4s<br>
Add internal plumbing, HVAC, electrical, and natural gas utilities<br>
Building inspector visits if necessary to approve utilities and framing<br>
Install insulation and interior drywall panels (cementboard for wet areas) and to complete walls and ceilings<br>
Install bathroom fixtures<br>
Spackle, prime, and paint interior walls and ceilings<br>
Additional tiling on top of cementboard for wet areas, such as the bathroom and kitchen backsplash<br>
Installation of final floor covering, such as floor tile, carpet, or wood flooring<br>
Installation of major appliances<br>
Unless the original owners are building the house, at this point it is typically sold or rented.<br>
